    "title": "An Introduction To Bayesian Statistics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The foundation for the Bayesian section of the blog\n\nTL;DR\nStatistics has long been a subject of great debate because of the way it is implmented. Due to “arbitrary” rules or guidelines that the academic community or business organizations follow in this field, it can be easy to be confused as to why certain numbers matter, if results from experiments actually have genuine impact, and how can we improve of the results we obtained. As well, what do we do when a test results contradicts what a subject matter expert says they expected to happen? Bayesian methods attempt to clear the confusion surrounding statistics. Bayesian methods allow us to incorporate our own knowledge into statistical modeling practices to properly draw conclusions from data. From those conclusions, we can gain direction and insight on what kind of decisions to make to better guide an organization.\n\n\nIntroduction: A New Place\n\n\n\nSuppose you just moved to a new town as a budding new data analyst. You wish to take advantage of the public transit found in said city and want to be on time every day to your new job. You look up the bus times associated with the closest bus stop to your house and see that the bus comes every 15 minutes starting on the hour. Using google maps, it appears that it takes about 45 mins to ride to your work on bus. You decide that you want to arrive at the bus station by no later than 8:15am to make the bus that will get you to your work by 9:00am. Sadly, where you live, the weather is not the best (especially in the morning) so the last thing you want to do is wait at the bus stop longer than necessary.\nFortunately, analyzing data and interpreting the data to drive actionable insights is your job! This is the perfect situation to apply some statistical methods to approximate accurately when you should arrive at the bus station to minimize the wait time at the bus while maximizing your likelihood of you making the bus. However, you don’t want to take a large sample size of data to confirm your hypothesis of when to arrive at the bus stop. Therefore, is there a way you can make accurate predictions about when to arrive at the bus stop to ensure you make the bus while not waiting forever for it?\nOne way to approach the above problem would be to use your prior knowledge of your old bus system. While it obviously is not the exact same as your old town, chances are they are very similar in reliability and frequency. Therefore, you conclude that if this new town’s bus system is similar to your old town’s system, the new bus would arrive about +- 3 minutes from its scheduled arrival time. After coming to this conclusion, you decide to arrive 5 minutes before the scheduled arrival time to ensure you would make the bus. You wait at the bus stop and the bus arrives 1 minute past its scheduled arrival time, meaning you waited there for 6 mins total. From this observation, you decide to arrive 3 minutes before the bus arrives, since perhaps the bus might always be late by 1 minute, but you want to still be sure you make the bus. This time, the bus arrives 1 minute before its scheduled arrival time, meaning you waited at the bus stop for 2 minutes. You repeat this process for a week. After a week, you feel like you have the bus times down. You conclude that 95% of the time the bus arrives within 2 minutes of its scheduled arrival time, so naturally the earliest you have to be at the bus stop is a little more than 2 minutes before its scheduled arrival time to make the bus while also not having to wait a long time.\n\n\nBayesian Inference: The Math Behind Updating Beliefs\nThe example above is a major simplification of the actual mathematical implementation of Bayesian inference. However, it does capture the idea that there is a way to update our belief in something by drawing on past data (prior belief) and updating that belief with new data that we observe, thus obtaining a a new distribution of uncertainty we use in judgements/calculations. The formula for this kind of thinking is shown below.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nP(H|\\theta) = \\frac{P(\\theta|H) P(H)}{P(\\theta)}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n\\[\\begin{equation} H = \\text{Our Hypothesis (prior)} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation}\\theta = \\text{Our Data} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation}P(H|\\theta) = \\text{Probability of observing our hypothesis given the data we've seen (posterior)} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation}P(H) = \\text{Probability of our hypothesis (prior)} \\end{equation}\\]  \\[\\begin{equation}P(\\theta|H) = \\text{Probability of our data given our hypothesis is true (likelihood)} \\end{equation}\\]  \\[\\begin{equation}P(\\theta) = \\text{Probability of our data} \\end{equation}\\]\n\nThe above formula is the generalized bayes formula used for bayesian statistical inference. To make the formula feel a bit more intuitive, let’s utilize our bus example. Our hypothesis \\((H)\\) was that the bus would arrive within +- 3 minutes of scheduled arrival time. We update this belief by conditioning on the data \\((\\theta)\\) we’ve seen. In our bus example, when we went to the bus stop for the first time, arriving 5 minutes early, the bus came within 1 minute of scheduled arrival time (1 minute late to be exact). Therefore, I updated my belief that if this is a normal bus day, this new bus system actually arrives in a closer timeframe than the previous bus system. However, since this was only my first day on the bus, I didn’t want to jump to any firm conclusions quite yet. I decided that I would experiment and try arriving 3 minutes early. From that, I observed that again the bus came within 1 minute of scheduled arrival (1 minute early to be exact).\nThis process of constantly updating is what the formula above generalizes. We all have prior beliefs/opinions about something, be it a bus system, train system, hospital, etc. that gets updated by new events (data) that we observe. This is the beauty of Bayesian statistics. Bayesian methods allow for constant updates rather than strong conclusions that other statistical methods endorse.\n\n\nCar Accidents: A Bayesian Example\nLet’s provide another example of the usefulness of Bayes theorem above. Hopefully this example, if the above formula and explanation still confuse you due to the math notation, will provide clarity on what all those symbols mean. Suppose you work for a car insurance company. Your company has three tiers of ages it covers:\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline Age & \\% clients \\\\\\hline\nYoung & 25\\% \\\\\nMiddle Age & 50\\% \\\\\nOld & 25\\%\n\\\\\\hline\n\\end{array}\\]"

    "text": "TL;DR\nWelcome to Bayesian Business! This blog focuses on the use of statistics, particularly bayesian statistics, in the application of business problems. In this post, we review the necessary math background in order to understand future blog posts. As well, we establish expectations for future blog posts and the order in which they are shared.\n\n\nWelcome To Bayesian Business\nWelcome to my blog! If you are reading this, I hope that means you are as excited about learning statistics as I am about teaching it (and continuing to learn it!). This blog, honestly, is mostly a tool for me to improve my own knowledge in statistics by learning how I would convey it to others. I plan on doing this from a data analysis perspective. Given a certain situation/set of data points, how do we construct the problems we want to solve and implement proper solutions. Particularly, I hope to demonstrate that Bayesian methods can be viable methods to solve problems in business, healthcare, etc. Anyways, I hope you find this blog interesting and useful in your data career. Whether you are just entering data or are an experienced data professional, this blog intends to be a resource in demonstrating good data analysis with sound applied mathematical theory.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nWhile I did mention above that this blog is intended to be useful for beginners and experts alike, I will admit that I will be covering some higher level math, such as:\n\n\nMultivariate Calculus\n\n\nProbability Theory\n\n\nLinear Algebra\n\n\nFor example, suppose we are studying a dataset with a variable that is modeled as an exponential random variable, we would use the below notation to show the probability density function (PDF)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\lambda e^{\\lambda x} \\,dx\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nX \\sim Exponential(\\lambda)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nOr, the important Bayes Theorem found below.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nDon’t be discourage if the above formulas don’t make sense right now. In each post that these appear, I will breakdown what they mean and their applicability in solving our problem.\n\n\nExpectations\nThe hope of this blog is to present statistics in the form of a data analysis case. For example, let’s say you are a host on AirBnB and want to maximize the number of nights you rent out. How do you properly price your rental given certain parameters (size, geographic setting, etc). We would then present the data points and walk through an analysis of the data by doing the following.\n\n\nExploring the data (EDA) to get to know our dataset\n\n\nConstructing a mathematical framework that can fit our data\n\n\nFit our data to said framework\n\n\nGather inference from our model\n\n\nReview answers explained by our model\n\n\nExplain possible enhancements to our model for future analyses\n\n\nThis will be our attempted framework to blog posts. I hope that by tackling problems in this way, our analytical toolbox will grow and our ability to construct measurable problems from our data will improve. This is the ultimate goal of this blog. I really hope that people will recognize this blog as an opportunity to learn how to think analytically.\n\n\nLet’s do this\nI just want to reiterate that I am excited to learn how to be a better analyst with you by getting to know the math that drives our analytics. I am very passionate about how data can be used to properly drive decision-making in organizations and I hope that this blog motivates you to do the same."
